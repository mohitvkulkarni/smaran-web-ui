**Welcome to Smaran Foundation\!**

Smaran Foundation is a Bangalore-based Charitable Trust committed to nurturing dignity, inclusion, and opportunity for all. We focus on empowering the underprivileged through education, advocating for mental health and well-being, supporting individuals with disabilities, championing women’s empowerment, environmental sustainability and offering compassionate disability and geriatric care.

Rooted in empathy and driven by action, our programs touch lives where it matters most — from classrooms to care homes, from urban slums to rural villages. We believe that sustainable change begins with collective effort — and _you_ are a part of that story.

Join us in building a society where no one is left behind. Feel free to contact us at anytime\!

## Mission Statement

Our Mission:

To build an inclusive and compassionate society by addressing the unmet needs of marginalized communities — through awareness, grassroots engagement, and insights and data-based action in the areas of education, disability, mental health, children and women’s empowerment, elder care, and sustainable development.

We are committed to listening first, learning continuously, and creating sustainable pathways to dignity and opportunity for all — especially those often left behind.

## Vision Statement

We Envision:

A world where every individual, regardless of circumstance, can live with dignity, access opportunity, and feel seen.

We envision communities where children learn without barriers, women lead without fear, the elderly age with respect, and no one is excluded because of disability or mental health struggles.

**Our Foundational Pillars**

Slide 1: Enabling Education for Every Child

_"Every child should have a reason to dream."_  
 Millions of children in India, especially in rural and underserved areas, continue to face barriers to basic education — from lack of infrastructure and learning materials to economic hardships at home. There remains an urgent need to reimagine how educational opportunity is created and delivered, especially in communities where learning is often interrupted or deprioritized. Our intent is to explore this need, listen, and understand what truly helps children stay in school and thrive.

---

Slide 2: Disability is Not Inability

_"Inclusion starts with awareness and accessibility."_  
 Disability often intersects with poverty, stigma, and invisibility. Many individuals with disabilities face challenges in access — to buildings, education, services, and even social acceptance. As a society, we still have a long way to go in embracing accessibility and dignity for all. We believe this is an area that deserves deeper attention and public engagement, and one that requires continuous dialogue and collective reflection.

---

Slide 3: Reframing Mental Health & Well-being

_"Mental health is not a luxury — it's a right."_  
 Mental health struggles are often silent, unspoken, and untreated — especially among underserved populations. Whether it’s due to stigma, lack of services, or simply not knowing who to talk to, millions live in quiet distress. Emotional well-being must become a community conversation. Building awareness and empathy is as important as offering care. We see the need to create space for such conversations — especially in overlooked places.

---

Slide 4: Empowering Women, Shaping Communities

_"Empowered women create resilient societies."_  
 Across India, countless women face systemic hurdles in accessing education, safety, income, and respect. Whether it's urban slums or remote villages, their voices are often unheard and their potential, underutilized. The idea of empowerment is not just about support, but about recognition, opportunity, and self-worth. This continues to be a space where thoughtful, grassroots-level engagement can make lasting change.

---

Slide 5: Dignity in Aging: Geriatric Care That Matters

_"Our elders deserve to feel seen, heard, and safe."_  
 Elderly individuals, especially those living alone or without financial support, face isolation, neglect, and health issues that often go unnoticed. In the absence of structured community care, aging with dignity becomes a privilege. Geriatric care must become a shared social responsibility — one that values presence, patience, and inclusion. There's a growing need to create environments where elders feel connected, secure, and respected.

Slide 6: **Sustaining Nature, Securing the Future**

_"A healthy planet is the foundation of a thriving society."_

Across India, rapid urbanisation, climate change, and unchecked resource exploitation threaten our forests, rivers, air, and soil. From polluted cityscapes to degraded rural ecosystems, the consequences of environmental neglect are already visible. Sustainability is not merely about conservation—it is about balance, responsibility, and foresight. Protecting our natural resources ensures livelihoods, preserves biodiversity, and safeguards the well-being of generations to come. This is a space where collective action and mindful living can create lasting, positive impact.

## About Us

We are a collective of millennials — lawyers, psychologists, counsellors, and community advocates, volunteers — who believe that real change begins with intentional collaboration. Each of us comes from a different walk of life, shaped by our own professional journeys, yet bound by a common goal: **to contribute towards building a more equitable, aware, and resilient society.**

**_![][image2]_**

At the heart of our initiative lies a simple yet powerful belief — **that knowledge, empathy, and structure have the power to uplift entire communities** when channelled with purpose. Our group didn’t begin as an organisation. It began as conversations between friends, clients, colleagues, and neighbours — about systemic gaps, overlooked voices, and how we could go beyond our professions to bridge those very gaps.

As lawyers, we’ve seen how the law can protect or fail depending on awareness and access. As psychologists, we’ve understood how often mental health is dismissed or buried under survival. As community organisers and educators, we’ve felt the urgency of voices that go unheard in decision-making processes. What brought us together was the idea that **our skills aren’t meant to stay siloed — they’re meant to be shared, adapted, and used for collective wellbeing.**

---

**Why Our Objectives Matter?**

Our objectives are not just organisational statements — they are personal promises. Promises to respond to the inequalities we have witnessed in courts, clinics, classrooms, and homes. Each objective is born out of something we’ve experienced first-hand:

- **To simplify legal access** because we’ve seen too many people kept away from justice due to jargon and gatekeeping. We aim to make laws understandable and accessible so that every individual knows their rights and protections. By removing barriers, we ensure justice is not a privilege, but a right for all.
- **To normalise mental health conversations** in everyday spaces, because we’ve seen how silence leads to suffering. We promote open, stigma-free discussions where seeking help is seen as a sign of strength. Through awareness and support, we aim to make mental well-being a shared priority.
- **To strengthen communities** through education, rights awareness, and dialogue, because we believe in long-term empowerment — not one-time relief. We work to create informed, resilient communities capable of driving their own growth. Collaboration and shared responsibility are encouraged to sustain progress over generations.
- **To empower women and youth**, recognising their potential as drivers of change.  
  Opportunities for leadership, skill-building, and economic independence are created to help them thrive. By fostering equality, we help build inclusive spaces where every voice is valued.
- **To promote sustainable environmental development and preservation**, ensuring that growth respects the planet. We support initiatives that protect natural resources while enabling eco-friendly livelihoods. Our goal is to leave a healthier, more resilient environment for future generations.
- **To champion disability inclusion**, ensuring dignity, access, and opportunity for all.  
  We work to remove physical, social, and systemic barriers faced by persons with disabilities. Through advocacy and action, we aim to build a society where ability is never underestimated.

In a world that’s increasingly fragmented, our objective is **to build bridges — between knowledge and people, between rights and reach, between care and access**. For us, this means not just working _for_ the community, but _with_ it — listening as much as we speak, learning as much as we teach.

---

**Who We’re Building this For?**

We are building this for —

Every young person who has questions but no mentors.  
Every parent who wants their child to thrive but doesn’t know what resources to trust.  
Every working adult who is burned out but afraid to seek help.  
Every individual who has a voice, a right, or a dream — but hasn’t yet found the words or support to claim them.

Our work is not just charity. It is a collaborative effort. We want to co-create solutions that are rooted in the lived realities of the people we engage with — whether in an urban settlement, a government school, a rural panchayat office, or simply a WhatsApp group. We do this through workshops, awareness sessions, resource sharing, legal clinics, psycho-social interventions, research reports, and storytelling — all designed to be inclusive, respectful, and practical.

---

**Why It Matters to Us?**

We are often told that millennials are impatient, idealistic, or distracted. But we’ve learned that idealism, when grounded in effort, can build movements. That impatience, when channelled right, becomes the urgency that change demands. And that being ‘distracted’ sometimes just means we’re paying attention to things the world prefers to ignore.

This initiative is our way of focusing that attention where it’s needed most — on people, systems, and stories that deserve care, clarity, and community.

We are not here to save anyone. We are here to walk alongside — with knowledge, compassion, and conviction.

Because in the end, **a better society isn’t built by a few experts. It’s built by everyday people showing up for each other with what they know, and what they care about.**

### Blog 1: Workplace Stress \- Is it Real?

**Author: Celina D’Souza**

**Date: April 2nd, 2025**

**3 min read**

**![][image3]**

**“It’s not stress that kills us, it is our reaction to it.” – Hans Selye**

Stress has been called the silent epidemic of the 21st century. As the world becomes faster, more connected, and increasingly demanding, one of the spaces most affected is the workplace. Stress at work isn’t just about feeling overwhelmed occasionally; it can have deep psychological, emotional, and even physical consequences.

**What Is Stress? – A Clinical Perspective**

Clinically, stress is defined as **a physiological and psychological response to external pressures or demands that exceed an individual’s perceived ability to cope**. According to the American Psychological Association (APA), stress is “the physiological or psychological response to internal or external stressors.” In the context of the workplace, these stressors could include tight deadlines, unrealistic performance expectations, toxic management styles, or even job insecurity.

Hans Selye, one of the first researchers to explore stress scientifically, described two types: **eustress** (positive, motivating stress) and **distress** (negative, overwhelming stress). It's the latter that poses serious risks in the modern workplace.

**What Experts and Studies Say**

According to a recent report by the World Health Organization (WHO), **over 60% of the global workforce experiences significant levels of work-related stress**. In India, the situation is particularly alarming due to economic and sociological reasons. A study by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) revealed that **89% of India’s workforce reports feeling stressed at work,** primarily due to workload, poor work-life balance, and job insecurity \- often with no organizational support or access to mental health care.

To put it in simple terms \- Imagine you’re trying to build a tall tower using blocks. You want to build it higher and higher, and people keep telling you to do it faster. But you’re tired, and the tower is getting wobbly. You try really hard, but your hands are shaking, and the tower falls. That feeling you get — worried, sad, tired, maybe even angry — that’s kind of what stress is. It happens when your brain and heart feel like they are trying to do too much all at once.

**When Stress Turns Dangerous**

While stress might seem like a common experience, its consequences can be life-altering. Here are two examples to show how workplace stress can spiral dangerously out of control:

**1\. Sara (name changed), 32, IT Professional – Death by Burnout**

Radhika worked for a leading IT services firm in Bengaluru. With 12-hour workdays, back-to-back meetings with global clients, and an unsupportive manager, her personal life dwindled. She began experiencing chronic fatigue, anxiety, and eventually depression. She expressed distress but was told to “manage better.” One morning, she was found unconscious due to a stress-induced heart attack. She survived, but her life changed forever. Her case is representative of **burnout**, a condition now officially recognized by the WHO as an occupational phenomenon.

**2\. Nishanth (name changed), 28, Start-up Employee – A Tragic Ending**

Arjun joined a high-growth startup with the dream of building something meaningful. But poor financial transparency, toxic leadership, and unrealistic growth targets pushed him to the edge. He was publicly shamed in team meetings and received emails at midnight questioning his commitment. After months of silent suffering and feeling trapped, he took his own life. His family had no idea how bad things had gotten. This is a heartbreaking example of how **unaddressed psychological stress can lead to suicide**, particularly among young professionals.

**Understanding the Psychology Behind Workplace Stress**

There are several psychological theories that help explain workplace stress:

Lazarus and Folkman's Transactional Model of Stress and Coping

Lazarus and Folkman’s Transactional Model frames stress not as a fixed condition, but as a dynamic interaction (or “transaction”) between an individual and their environment. In this view, stress arises when a person perceives that the demands placed upon them exceed their personal resources—whether those resources are emotional, cognitive, physical, or time-related. For example, an employee facing back-to-back deadlines, multiple stakeholders, and unclear job expectations may appraise the situation as threatening if they believe they lack the ability, support, or time to cope effectively. The key here is _perception_—two individuals in the same role may experience differing levels of stress depending on how they evaluate their capacity to manage. This model is deeply relevant to workload-related stress because high-volume tasks, tight timelines, or vague deliverables often create the kind of "imbalance" that triggers stress. Unless coping mechanisms—like support systems, autonomy, or realistic expectations—are introduced, the stress response can persist or escalate.

The Job-Demand-Control (JDC) Model by Robert Karasek

Karasek’s Job-Demand-Control Model is one of the most influential frameworks in occupational health psychology. It argues that the highest levels of stress occur in jobs with high demands and low control. “Demands” refer to workload, time pressure, and mental effort, while “control” refers to the degree of decision-making power or autonomy an employee has over how they do their job. A worker who is constantly told _what_ to do, _when_ to do it, and _how_ to do it, with little room for discretion, experiences low control—even if they are capable and experienced. Now imagine that same worker is also under pressure to meet aggressive targets or juggle multiple projects—that’s a textbook case of high stress according to the JDC model. In contrast, high-demand jobs that also allow for high levels of autonomy—like senior management or creative roles—tend to produce lower stress levels, as individuals feel empowered to manage their own workload and pace. Thus, in the context of workload stress, this model shows that giving employees more say over how they work can significantly buffer the negative effects of heavy demands.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs

Abraham Maslow’s theory of human motivation, famously depicted as a pyramid, posits that people are driven by a set of hierarchical needs: physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging, esteem, and finally self-actualization. In the workplace, salary addresses the basic physiological and safety needs. But true job satisfaction and mental well-being come from fulfilling the higher-order needs—such as being respected, feeling a sense of belonging, and having opportunities to grow and reach one’s full potential. Workload stress becomes particularly toxic when it undermines these higher needs. For instance, employees who are overloaded with tasks and not given recognition may begin to feel invisible, undervalued, or expendable. A lack of appreciation, exclusion from team decisions, or being denied promotions can damage their self-esteem and sense of belonging. Over time, such unmet psychological needs—compounded by overwork—can lead to emotional exhaustion, disengagement, or even depression. According to Maslow, unless organizations support growth, esteem, and connection, merely offering a paycheck is not enough to sustain employee well-being in high-pressure environments.

These three frameworks, while distinct, together highlight why workload stress is not just about the quantity of work, but about how work is experienced, perceived, and supported. Lazarus and Folkman show the importance of _perceived coping ability_, Karasek underscores the role of _autonomy_, and Maslow reminds us that _human needs go far beyond productivity metrics_. Addressing workload stress, therefore, requires more than task redistribution—it calls for empowering employees, respecting their psychological needs, and fostering environments where individuals feel in control, supported, and valued.

**What Can Be Done to Manage and Reduce Stress**

1. **At the organizational level**:

   - Regular mental health check-ins

   - Workload management policies

   - Anonymous grievance redressal mechanisms

   - Training managers to recognize burnout symptoms

   - Encouraging flexible work arrangements

2. **At the individual level**:

   - Setting personal boundaries around work hours

   - Seeking help early (therapy, peer groups)

   - Mindfulness, meditation, and regular physical activity

   - Maintaining a support system outside work

Workplace stress is no longer just “part of the job.” It’s a critical mental health issue with serious consequences for both individuals and organizations. When stress goes unrecognized or untreated, it doesn't just hurt performance—it can destroy lives.

As organizations strive for growth, innovation, and efficiency, they must also prioritize the psychological safety of their people. Because no deadline, no metric, and no profit is ever worth the human cost of neglecting mental well-being.

### Blog 2: Disability in India: Dignity, Challenges, and the Power of Inclusion

_“The only disability in life is a bad attitude.” – Scott Hamilton_

In a rapidly developing country like India, the word _"disability"_ often evokes images of limitation, dependency, or hardship. But disability, at its core, is not a tragedy. What truly disables a person is an inaccessible society. This blog dives into what disability means in today’s India — at an individual, societal, and systemic level — and why inclusion, empathy, and support are more crucial than ever.

---

What Is Disability? A Broader Definition

Disability is no longer viewed merely as a medical condition. The modern understanding, endorsed by the World Health Organization and India’s own Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, defines it as the **interaction between a person’s impairments and the societal or environmental barriers that limit full participation in life**.

This shift in definition recognizes that **it’s not just a limb, a sense, or a mental condition that limits someone — it’s society’s failure to adapt** that makes life harder. For example, a person with a hearing impairment isn’t disabled in a world where sign language is standard. A person in a wheelchair isn’t disabled in a city with accessible transport.

---

Disability in India: The 2024 Snapshot

India has made efforts in recent years to capture the scale of disability more accurately:

- As of 2024, approximately **4.5% of the Indian population** (about 63 million people) live with some form of disability.

- **One in every 20 households** has at least one disabled member.

- **Locomotor disabilities** (affecting movement) are the most common (45%), followed by speech, hearing, and mental health-related disabilities.

- Prevalence is higher among **men**, the **elderly**, those with **lower education levels**, and the **economically disadvantaged**.

Yet, numbers alone don’t paint the full picture. Behind every percentage point is a human story — of resilience, struggle, and the fight for dignity.

---

Living with a Disability: What It Really Means

The Individual Experience

At a personal level, disability can reshape a person’s identity, agency, and daily life. Depending on the condition, it may:

- Restrict physical mobility or independence

- Limit access to education or work

- Impact communication and social interaction

- Affect mental health and emotional well-being

But equally, individuals with disabilities can be writers, athletes, entrepreneurs, and changemakers — **if** the right support systems are in place.

The Social Experience

Society often perpetuates ableism — a bias against people with disabilities — in both subtle and overt ways. From the lack of accessible infrastructure to discriminatory hiring practices and social stigma, people with disabilities are regularly excluded from mainstream life.

Even well-meaning charity can sometimes strip people of their agency by positioning them as objects of pity rather than individuals with rights, choices, and dreams.

---

Types of Disabilities and Economic Impact

There are many forms of disabilities, each with distinct economic and personal implications:

- **Locomotor Disabilities**: May require wheelchairs, walking aids, or modifications at home/work. Lack of transport or inaccessible buildings can make even basic employment difficult.

- **Visual and Hearing Impairments**: Require assistive technologies (like screen readers, Braille devices, or hearing aids). But if workplaces or schools aren’t adapted, even the best tech can’t bridge the gap.

- **Cognitive or Intellectual Disabilities**: May need lifelong support. Families often bear high medical and care costs, sometimes without state support.

- **Multiple or Complex Disabilities**: These demand a combination of medical, emotional, and logistical help, placing even greater pressure on caregivers.

In every case, a common thread emerges: **disability often pushes people toward poverty**, especially in the absence of social safety nets or inclusive employment.

---

Why Dignity is Often Denied

Why is it so difficult for people with disabilities to live with dignity in India?

1. **Social Stigma**: Many still view disability as something to be ashamed of or hidden.

2. **Inaccessible Public Spaces**: Schools, offices, transport systems, and even hospitals are often not disability-friendly.

3. **Lack of Awareness**: Even caregivers and institutions may not know how to support or empower disabled people.

4. **Economic Dependency**: Without education or employment, individuals can’t become financially independent — a key to living with self-respect.

5. **Violence and Discrimination**: Studies show that people with disabilities are at a higher risk of abuse, especially women and children.

---

Gender Matters: Male vs. Female Disability Experience

While more men report disabilities in national surveys, **women with disabilities face deeper, layered discrimination**. They are more likely to:

- Be denied education

- Be kept hidden within homes

- Receive less medical care

- Experience violence or abuse

The **intersection of gender and disability** leads to compounded exclusion. A disabled girl in a rural area may never step into a school or a clinic, not because she can’t — but because no one expects her to.

---

What About the Family? What About the Elderly?

Disability doesn't exist in a vacuum. It affects entire families — emotionally, financially, and socially.

- **For parents of disabled children**, life can mean endless hospital visits, paperwork for disability certification, and emotional exhaustion from societal judgment.

- **For spouses or siblings**, caregiving becomes a permanent part of life.

- **For the elderly**, age-related disability is often ignored, dismissed as “natural,” with limited medical and social care infrastructure.

In all cases, the **care burden typically falls on women** — mothers, wives, daughters — often without compensation or respite.

---

Living with Dignity: Support Systems Matter

It’s not all bleak. Progress is happening:

- **Inclusive education** is now a legal right under the RPwD Act.

- Programs like **Accessible India** are pushing for better urban design.

- **NGOs and social enterprises** are innovating assistive technology, creating jobs, and building awareness.

- The 2025 CBSE results showed that **students with disabilities had a 93–96% pass rate** — a sign that with the right support, anything is possible.

Still, rural areas remain underserved, and many policies fail in implementation. True dignity comes not just from handouts, but from independence, access, and opportunity.

---

What Does Charity Really Mean?

Often, when we hear the word _charity_, we think of money given in pity or sympathy. But true charity is **solidarity**. It means:

- Recognizing someone’s worth, not just their need

- Supporting their inclusion, not just survival

- Creating opportunities, not dependency

When you donate, volunteer, or even advocate for better policies, you’re telling someone, _“You matter. You deserve more.”_

And in doing so, **you grow too** — in empathy, connection, and purpose. There’s a deep joy in knowing that you helped someone live a more dignified life.

---

Why Should You Care?

Because disability is not someone else’s issue. A car crash, a medical condition, or even aging can make anyone disabled at any time. Building a more inclusive society isn't a favor to others — it’s an **investment in all our futures**.

So donate. Volunteer. Include. Learn. Share.

Disability is not a deficit — it's a dimension of diversity. And only when everyone is included, respected, and empowered can we truly call our society just.

_“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” – Nelson Mandela_

India is a country of immense diversity and potential. With a population of over 1.4 billion, it is home to one of the largest education systems in the world. Yet, this system continues to face a severe and persistent divide — especially between urban and rural populations. In the context of rural India, education is not just a tool for knowledge, but a gateway to opportunity, dignity, and socio-economic upliftment. Despite constitutional guarantees and numerous policy interventions, rural education in India still grapples with fundamental issues that prevent millions of children from accessing and completing quality schooling.

---

The Ground Reality of Education in Rural India

According to recent data from the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) and Ministry of Education (2023–24), approximately **65% of India’s population resides in rural areas**, where access to basic education remains a challenge. While primary school enrollment has improved significantly in the last two decades, dropout rates after Class 5 and Class 8 remain alarmingly high. Many schools in rural districts suffer from a lack of infrastructure, qualified teachers, learning materials, and digital access.

Even where schools are present, the quality of education is often poor. Many rural children attend classes in overcrowded rooms, with inadequate sanitation, minimal extracurricular exposure, and rote-based learning practices. A large number of students struggle with foundational literacy and numeracy, leading to a lack of confidence and gradual disinterest in education.

The **COVID-19 pandemic** only worsened this divide. As education shifted online, millions of rural students were left behind due to lack of devices, electricity, internet access, or parental support. This has created a new form of educational inequality — the **digital divide** — which threatens to widen existing socio-economic gaps even further.

---

The Domino Effect: What Happens When Education Is Denied

When a child is denied access to quality education, the impact is not just personal — it ripples across families, communities, and generations.

1. **Poverty Becomes Intergenerational**: Without basic education, individuals struggle to find stable employment or earn a living wage. This traps families in cycles of poverty, often forcing children to work instead of study.

2. **Health and Hygiene Suffer**: Lack of education also correlates with poor health outcomes. Uneducated individuals may not understand the importance of nutrition, sanitation, vaccinations, or family planning, resulting in poor community health.

3. **Women and Girls Are Left Behind**: Girls in rural areas are particularly at risk. Without schooling, many are married off early, subjected to domestic violence, and denied autonomy. Education is a proven way to delay marriage, reduce fertility rates, and empower women economically and socially.

4. **Social Injustice Is Reinforced**: Education can challenge caste discrimination, gender bias, and exclusion. Without it, social hierarchies remain rigid, and marginalised communities continue to be oppressed.

5. **Crime and Exploitation Increase**: Illiteracy can also lead to a rise in crime, child trafficking, and exploitation, as individuals without education or employment may fall prey to unsafe work conditions or illegal activities.

Education is more than a right — it is a **lifeline**, especially in rural India.

---

Why the Indian Education System Struggles in Rural Areas

Several structural and operational challenges contribute to the rural education crisis in India:

- **Infrastructure Deficits**: Many rural schools lack basic facilities like toilets, electricity, clean drinking water, libraries, and playgrounds.

- **Teacher Shortages and Absenteeism**: Qualified teachers are often unwilling to work in remote areas. Those who do may not receive adequate training or support.

- **Language and Cultural Barriers**: The use of a non-local language for instruction can alienate tribal or minority children, making learning difficult and disjointed.

- **Low Parental Literacy**: Many parents in rural communities have little or no education themselves, making it hard for them to assist or motivate their children.

- **Economic Pressures**: Families facing economic hardship may prioritize short-term income (through child labour or farm work) over long-term investment in education.

- **Gender Norms**: Patriarchal attitudes often deprioritize education for girls, especially when household responsibilities or safety concerns arise.

---

The Role of NGOs in Transforming Rural Education

In the face of these daunting challenges, **non-governmental organizations (NGOs)** have emerged as a beacon of hope. Operating across remote corners of India, NGOs play a crucial role in:

1. **Establishing Community Schools**: In areas where government schools are inaccessible or underperforming, NGOs often set up learning centres that are closer, safer, and culturally relevant.

2. **Supplementing Learning**: Many NGOs provide after-school programs, remedial classes, and bridge courses to help children catch up on learning gaps.

3. **Training Teachers**: By offering pedagogy workshops, teaching materials, and monitoring support, NGOs help improve the capacity and motivation of rural educators.

4. **Promoting Digital Literacy**: Through mobile classrooms, solar-powered tablets, and low-tech solutions like radio learning, NGOs bridge the digital divide in underserved communities.

5. **Empowering Girls**: Special initiatives focus on keeping girls in school, providing menstrual hygiene support, scholarships, and community awareness campaigns.

6. **Parent and Community Engagement**: NGOs conduct home visits, form parent-teacher groups, and build local accountability mechanisms to ensure sustained enrollment and attendance.

7. **Policy Advocacy**: By gathering on-ground data and success stories, NGOs also influence government policies to be more inclusive, equitable, and responsive to rural needs.

In essence, NGOs act as **connective tissue** between government schemes, community aspirations, and the holistic development of children.

---

The Road Ahead: Collaboration is Key

If India is to become a truly equitable and developed nation, rural education must be at the heart of our growth strategy. No child should be denied the right to learn, grow, and dream because of their pin code. To achieve this, **government, private sector, communities, and civil society must work hand in hand**.

### **Blog 4: Title: _“Prakash’s Dream: A Vegetable Seller’s Journey to Dignity and Education”_**

Author: Sanjana Fernandes

Date: May 10th, 2025

![][image6]

In the quiet, dusty lanes of Kallapuram — a remote village tucked deep into the folds of southern India — lived Prakash, a humble vegetable seller. Each morning, before the sun could warm the soil, he would load his bamboo basket with fresh produce from the nearby fields and make his way to the weekly market, calling out prices with a hopeful voice and an honest smile.

Prakash didn’t have much by way of money or education. His own schooling had stopped before he could learn to write his name in English, and words like “SSLC” or “PUC” held little meaning for him. What he _did_ know, and clung to with conviction, was the term he had once overheard in a town bazaar — _“metriculation.”_ To him, that single word meant the key to a better life, a door that might open for his children, Rani and Ravi.

He was clear about one thing: _they must study up to metriculation,_ and if possible, beyond.

But dreams are delicate things in a village like Kallapuram. Families here lived under the weight of generations-old loans taken from powerful landlords, who charged interest like leeches. Many of Prakash’s neighbors had mortgaged their land and lives, caught in an endless cycle of poverty and dependence. Prakash refused. He made it his life’s mission to never fall into that trap — not for himself, and not for his children.

He believed that education was their only route to freedom.

Despite earning barely enough to cover meals, he bought second-hand textbooks, patched school uniforms, and even sold a small piece of inherited land to buy his children a used smartphone — not for entertainment, but for internet access. “They must have internet,” he insisted, believing it was the window to the world beyond Kallapuram.

Knowing he couldn’t guide them himself, he searched for someone who could. Through a distant cousin who had moved to the city, Prakash found a man who worked with an NGO and had access to educational guides and mentor networks. The man was moved by Prakash’s persistence and connected Rani and Ravi to online courses that taught foundational skills — spoken English, basic computing, and most importantly, teacher training modules.

Rani, shy but curious, took to the idea of becoming a teacher. Ravi, who had once dreamed of becoming a mechanic, was inspired by a success story he saw in one of their modules — a young man from a tribal village who had gone on to teach children and open a small digital learning center. Slowly, the siblings began seeing teaching not just as a job, but as a mission.

**In a place where children are often neglected, silenced, or pushed into labor, Prakash’s quiet support gave Rani and Ravi something most others lacked — belief.** That belief had a powerful psychological impact. It gave them emotional security, the freedom to dream, and the courage to pursue something beyond mere survival. Their mental health was not a conversation in their village, but within their small home, it became a priority. Prakash made sure they were not just fed and clothed, but _heard._

**With only the little support he could give — time, encouragement, and protection from financial traps — they were able to do remarkably well.** Their resilience was shaped as much by emotional stability as by education.

Eventually, Rani and Ravi completed their basic teacher training from a rural education program supported by the district government. They passed the eligibility test and were appointed to government schools — right in the heart of neighboring villages that had never seen young teachers from their own soil.

The day their appointment letters arrived, Prakash wept. Not out of sadness, but out of pride. For the first time, a vegetable seller's children had secured government jobs in their family. They wore ironed clothes, carried books, and walked into school with heads held high — _not as students, but as teachers._

He didn’t need riches. He didn’t need respect from landlords. Prakash had already won.

Now, in the same village where credit traps were a way of life, where schooling was often seen as a luxury, he had rewritten his family’s story. His home became a small beacon of hope — not just because Rani and Ravi were teachers, but because they mentored younger children in the evenings and spoke openly about mental well-being, self-worth, and resilience. They taught their students that even in the remotest corners of the country, dreams — if guarded by courage and guided by care — _can_ come true.

And every morning, Prakash still goes to the market. But now, he is known not just as the man who sells vegetables — but as the father who sowed the seeds of dignity, and grew a future that his village never thought was possible.

### Blog 5: ಶೀರ್ಷಿಕೆ: ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್‌ನ ಕನಸು – ಹಣ್ಣು ತರಕಾರಿ ಮಾರುವ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯ التعೈಷ್ಣ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ವಿದ್ಯೆಯ ಪಯಣ

ದಕ್ಷಿಣ ಭಾರತದ ದೂರದ ಕೂಡಲೆ ಹಳ್ಳಿಯೊಂದರಲ್ಲಿ ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್ ಎಂಬ ಹಣ್ಣು ತರಕಾರಿ ಮಾರುವ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿ ವಾಸಿಸುತ್ತಿದ್ದ. ಪ್ರತಿದಿನವೂ ಬೆಳಗಿನ ಜಾವ, ಸೂರ್ಯೋದಯಕ್ಕೂ ಮುನ್ನಾ, ಸ್ಥಳೀಯ ಹೊಲಗಳಿಂದ ತರಕಾರಿ ಎತ್ತಿಕೊಂಡು ಮಾರುಕಟ್ಟೆಗೆ ಹೊರಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ಅವನು, ಸರಳ ವೇಷದಲ್ಲಿ, ನಗುಮುಖದಿಂದ ತನ್ನ ಗ್ರಾಹಕರನ್ನು ಕರೆಯುತ್ತಿದ್ದ.

ಅವನಿಗೇನು ಹೆಚ್ಚು ಶಿಕ್ಷಣವಿರಲಿಲ್ಲ, ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷಿನಲ್ಲಿ ತನ್ನ ಹೆಸರನ್ನೇ ಬರೆಯಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಗದಷ್ಟರ ಮಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ಶಾಲೆ ನಿಲ್ಲಿಸಬೇಕಾಗಿತ್ತು. ಆದರೆ, 'ಎಸ್‌ಎಸ್‌ಎಲ್‌ಸಿ' ಅಥವಾ 'ಪಿಯುಸಿ' ಅರ್ಥವೇನೂ ಗೊತ್ತಿರದ ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್, ಒಂದು ಸಲ ಟೌನ್‌ ಬಜಾರ್‌ನಲ್ಲಿ ಕೇಳಿದ್ದ 'ಮೆಟ್ರಿಕ್ಯುಲೇಷನ್' ಅನ್ನೋ ಪದವನ್ನ ಹಿಡಿದಿಟ್ಟುಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದ. ಅವನಿಗೆ ಅದು ಮಕ್ಕಳ ಭವಿಷ್ಯದ ಬಾಗಿಲು ಎಂಬ ನಂಬಿಕೆ.

ಅವನಿಗೆ ಒಂದು ಮಾತ್ರ ಸ್ಪಷ್ಟ – _ಅವನ ಮಕ್ಕಳು ಮೆಟ್ರಿಕ್ಯುಲೇಷನ್‌ವರೆಗೆ ಓದಬೇಕು._ ಅದರಾಚೆಗೂ ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾದಷ್ಟು ಹೋಗಬೇಕು.

ಆದರೆ ಪ್ರತಿ ಹಳ್ಳಿಯಂತೆ ಈ ಹಳ್ಳಿಯಲ್ಲೂ ಕನಸುಗಳು ಬಹಳ ದುರ್ಲಭ. ಇಲ್ಲಿ ಹೆಚ್ಚಿನ ಕುಟುಂಬಗಳು ಜಮೀನುದಾರರ ಸಾಲದಲ್ಲಿ ಮುಳುಗಿ, ತಲೆದೋರಿದ ಬಡ್ಡಿದರಗಳಲ್ಲಿ ಬದುಕುತಿದ್ದವು. ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್‌ ಮಾತ್ರ ಸಾಲವಿಲ್ಲದೆ ಬದುಕು ಸಾಗಿಸಲು ಪಣತೊಟ್ಟಿದ್ದ. ಅವನ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗಾಗಿ ಏನಾದರೂ ಮಾಡಬೇಕು ಎಂಬ ತೀರ್ಮಾನದಿಂದ, ಅವನು ತನ್ನ ಜೀವನವನ್ನೇ ಬದಲಾಯಿಸಿದ.

ಹಣದ ಕೊರತೆಯ ಮಧ್ಯೆಯೂ, ಬಳಕೆದಾರರ ಪುಸ್ತಕಗಳನ್ನು ಕೊಳ್ಳುತ್ತಿದ್ದ, ಹಳೆಯ ಡ್ರೆಸ್‌ಗಳನ್ನು ಹೊಲಕಿದ್ದ, ಮತ್ತು ಅಂತಿಮವಾಗಿ ಇಂಟರ್ನೆಟ್‌ ಬಳಸುವಂತೆ ಒಂದು ಬಳಕೆದಾರ ಮೊಬೈಲ್‌ ಕೂಡಾ ಖರೀದಿಸಿದ್ದ – ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ “ಇಂಟರ್ನೆಟ್ ಬೇಕೆ” ಎಂಬುದು ಅವನ ಹಠವಾಗಿತ್ತು. ಅವನು ಅರ್ಥಮಾಡಿಕೊಂಡಿದ್ದ – _ಇದು ಅವರ ಲೋಕವನ್ನು ವಿಸ್ತರಿಸುವ ಕಿಟಕಿ._

ಅವನಿಗೆ ಮಾರ್ಗದರ್ಶನ ನೀಡಲು ಯಾರಾದರೂ ಬೇಕು ಎಂಬ ಹಂಬಲದಿಂದ, ನಗರದ ಎನ್‌ಜಿಒ ಸದಸ್ಯನೊಂದಿಗೆ ಸಂಪರ್ಕ ಸಾಧಿಸಿದ. ಆ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ಕೌಶಲ್ಯ ತರಬೇತಿ, ಇಂಗ್ಲಿಷ್ ಮಾತನಾಡುವುದು, ಕಂಪ್ಯೂಟರ್ ಪಾಠಗಳು, ಮತ್ತು ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರ ತರಬೇತಿ ಕೋರ್ಸ್‌ಗಳಿಗೆ ದಾರಿ ತೋರಿಸಿದ.

ರಾಣಿ ಮತ್ತು ರವಿ – ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್‌ನ ಮಕ್ಕಳು – ಒಂದರ ಹಿಂದೊಂದರಂತೆ ಈ ತರಬೇತಿಗಳನ್ನು ಬಳಸಿಕೊಂಡು ಮುಂದೆ ಸಾಗಿದರು. ಅವರು ಕೇಳಿದ ಪ್ರೇರಣಾದಾಯಕ ಕಥೆಗಳು, ಇವರೊಳಗಿನ ಶಕ್ತಿ ಮತ್ತು ನಂಬಿಕೆಯನ್ನು ರೂಪಿಸಿದವು.

**ಈ ಹಳ್ಳಿಯಲ್ಲಿ ಮರೆಯಲ್ಪಡುವ, ಮೌನವಾಗಿರುವ ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್ ನೀಡಿದ ಅಲ್ಪ ಬೆಂಬಲವೇ ಅವರ ಬದುಕನ್ನು ಬದಲಾಯಿಸಿತು.** ಅವರು ಶಿಕ್ಷಣ ಪಡೆಯಲು ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲ, ಆತ್ಮವಿಶ್ವಾಸ ಬೆಳೆಸಿಕೊಳ್ಳಲು ಸಾಧ್ಯವಾಯಿತು. ಅವರ ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಆರೋಗ್ಯವೂ ಪರಿಗಣನೆಯಲ್ಲಿತ್ತದು – ಅವರು ಬಡವರಾಗಿದ್ದರೂ ಮುದ್ದಾಗಿ ಮಾತನಾಡುವ ತಂದೆಯಿದ್ದ, ಕೇಳಲು ಸಿದ್ಧನಿದ್ದ ಕುಟುಂಬವಿತ್ತು.

**ಅವನ ಧೈರ್ಯ ಮತ್ತು ಸಹನೆಯ ಮನೋಭಾವನೆ – ಮಾತ್ರವಲ್ಲದೆ ಮಕ್ಕಳೊಂದಿಗೆ ತೋರಿಸಿದ ಗೌರವ** – ಇವುಗಳಿಂದ ಅವರೊಳಗಿನ ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಸ್ಥಿರತೆ ಬೆಳೆದಿತು. ಅದು ಅವರ ಸಾಧನೆಯ ಬುನಾದಿಯಾಗಿತ್ತು.

ವರ್ಷಗಳ ಪರಿಶ್ರಮದ ನಂತರ, ಅವರು ಗ್ರಾಮೀಣ ಶಿಕ್ಷಕರಾಗಿ ನೇಮಕಗೊಂಡರು. ಆ ದಿನದ ನೇಮಕ ಪತ್ರ ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್‌ಗೆ ಬಿಟ್ಟಿದ್ದ ಜೀವಿತ ಉಡುಗೊರೆ. ಅವರು ಶಾಲೆಗೆ ಹೋಗುವಾಗ ಪಾಠ ಹೇಳಲು ಹೊರಡುತ್ತಿದ್ದ ದೃಶ್ಯ, ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್‌ ಕಣ್ಣೀರಿನಿಂದಲೇ ಕಂಡ ಕನಸು.

ಇಂದು ಅವರ ಮನೆ ಇಡೀ ಹಳ್ಳಿಗೆ ಮಾದರಿಯಾಗಿದೆ. ಅವರು ಮಕ್ಕಳಿಗೆ ರಾತ್ರಿ ಪಾಠ ಹೇಳುತ್ತಾರೆ, ಆತ್ಮಸ್ಥೈರ್ಯ, ಮಾನಸಿಕ ಕ್ಷೇಮತೆ, ಕನಸುಗಳನ್ನು ಬೆಳೆಸುವುದರ ಮಹತ್ವವನ್ನು ಬೋಧಿಸುತ್ತಾರೆ.

ಪ್ರಕಾಶ್ ಇನ್ನೂ ಮಾರುಕಟ್ಟೆಗೆ ಹೋಗುತ್ತಾನೆ. ಆದರೆ ಈಗ, ಅವನು ಕೇವಲ ತರಕಾರಿ ಮಾರುವ ವ್ಯಕ್ತಿಯಾಗಿಲ್ಲ – ಅವನು ಕನಸುಗಳ ಬೆಳೆಗಾರನು, ಮಗುವಿನ ಭವಿಷ್ಯ ನಿರ್ಮಾಪಕನು.

### Blog 6: Why Every Community Needs a Centralised Database: A Game-Changer for Local Welfare

**Author: Mohit K (if you dont mind. Else, you can flip it to my name)**

**Date: May 16th, 2025**

**3 min read**

**![][image7]**

In a remote part of North Karnataka, a small charitable group began distributing school supplies and mid-day meal kits to underprivileged children. Their intent was pure — but within weeks, they realised the distribution was uneven. Some children had received double, while others were missed entirely. Some had dropped out of school months ago, but no one knew. Their biggest challenge? There was **no clear data** about the community.

This is a familiar story across India — from the outskirts of Bengaluru to tribal pockets in the Northeast — where charitable efforts often falter not due to lack of goodwill, but due to **a lack of organised, updated information**.

---

Why a Centralised Community Database Matters

Imagine if each village, slum, or low-income neighbourhood had a basic but well-maintained record of residents — including family size, income level, education status, access to health care, disabilities, housing conditions, and so on. It doesn't need to be digital or complex. Even a notebook or spreadsheet can become a powerful planning tool.

This kind of **community intelligence** helps ensure that aid goes to the right hands, at the right time, without overlap or neglect.

---

A Story from a Remote Bengaluru Settlement

In a lesser-known settlement on the outskirts of Bengaluru, a group of volunteers began a blanket distribution drive one winter. With no data in hand, they went house to house — only to later realise that many people already had sufficient winter wear from previous drives. Meanwhile, newly-arrived migrant families living in makeshift shelters were overlooked entirely.

The following year, they started collecting basic information from households in advance: number of residents, sleeping conditions, and whether they already had warm clothing. Using just paper forms and a few volunteer visits, they built a basic register.

That year, not a single blanket was wasted. Each one went to someone who truly needed it. All it took was **organised, community-level information**.

---

Empowering Forgotten Children Through Data

In a remote village in Odisha, many children had dropped out of school silently — due to family migration, health issues, or lack of support. A local teacher, with help from a few volunteers, began tracking these dropouts through a simple handwritten ledger.

What followed was transformational. With just basic data — names, ages, reasons for dropping out — they were able to bring some of them back into schooling, connect families to scholarships, and organise weekend mental health sessions for children.

**When children are counted and noticed, they feel seen. That itself becomes psychological support.** They feel they matter. For families living in poverty or isolation, this sense of dignity — of being _part of something_ — has long-term emotional and educational value.

---

Key Benefits of Community Data Collection

📌 Better Targeting of Help

Whether it’s food kits, scholarships, or health check-ups, resources reach those who actually need them — not just those who are visible.

♻️ No Duplication

When there's a record, help isn’t repeated for the same people while others go without.

🔄 Ongoing Updates

Data that’s reviewed every 6 to 12 months can reflect real changes — like job loss, migration, illness, or births.

🧠 Addresses Invisible Needs

Tracking can uncover silent issues like mental health needs, school dropouts, elderly neglect, or nutritional deficiencies — which often go unnoticed in mass outreach.

🤝 Better Coordination Between Multiple Groups

If multiple volunteers, trusts, or local leaders work off the same data set, they can avoid overlaps and pool resources better.

How to Start Building a Community Database

You don’t need fancy software or funding. Even small efforts can begin with these simple steps:

1. **Start Small:** Use paper forms or spreadsheets.

2. **Train Local Volunteers:** Ask schoolteachers, students, or ASHA workers to help gather and verify data.

3. **Keep it Respectful:** Ensure families know their data is used only for their welfare, with consent and privacy.

4. **Categorise Simply:** Group data by age, income, school status, disability, housing, and current needs.

5. **Update Periodically:** Once every 6 months is often enough.

What Happens When Communities Take Ownership

In one drought-prone region in central India, a group of mothers and youth came together to document the number of homes without toilets, children without birth certificates, and elderly without pensions. With that list, they approached both NGOs and local government schemes. Within a year, the village saw an increase in access to clean water, government rations, and even digital literacy classes.

The difference wasn’t external help. It was **data**, backed by community will.

---

Conclusion: Data is Dignity

In India, where so many communities are overlooked by formal systems, data becomes a way to reclaim visibility. It’s a step towards equity. When someone knocks on your door knowing your child’s name, your needs, your potential — it builds trust.

**No child should be forgotten just because they weren’t counted. No family should miss help because their name wasn’t written down.**

So whether you’re a volunteer, a charitable trust, or a concerned citizen — start with the list. Count. Record. Organise.

Because the first step to helping better is **knowing better**.

### Blog 8: Poverty and Education in India: A Vicious Cycle

Author: William F

![][image9]

India, with its vast population and diverse socio-economic fabric, continues to struggle with the interlinked challenges of poverty and education. While significant strides have been made in improving access to education, the connection between poverty and educational inequality remains a critical barrier to inclusive development. The relationship is complex: poverty restricts access to quality education, and lack of education, in turn, perpetuates poverty across generations.

The Cost of Education in a Poor Household

For millions of families living below the poverty line in India, education often takes a backseat to survival. Children from economically disadvantaged backgrounds are frequently forced into labor to supplement household income. Even when government schools provide free education, the associated costs—uniforms, books, transportation, and exam fees—can be too much for poor families to bear.

In rural areas, these issues are magnified by limited school infrastructure, teacher shortages, and lack of digital access. Girls in poor families are particularly vulnerable, often facing early marriage or domestic responsibilities instead of classroom learning.

Dropout Rates and Quality Gaps

High dropout rates in secondary education are a telling indicator of the economic pressures faced by poor students. According to various government reports, a large percentage of students from underprivileged families leave school before completing Class 10\. Those who remain often attend under-resourced schools, where overcrowded classrooms, lack of trained teachers, and minimal learning materials affect the quality of education.

Private schools, often seen as a route to better opportunities, are out of reach for many poor families. The disparity in educational quality between urban private institutions and rural government schools contributes to a widening socio-economic gap.

The Long-Term Impact

Without access to quality education, children from poor families are unable to break free from the cycle of poverty. They often end up in low-wage, unstable jobs, lacking the skills and qualifications necessary for upward mobility. This leads to intergenerational poverty, where economic disadvantages are passed down, generation after generation.

Conversely, education is a powerful tool for empowerment. Educated individuals are more likely to secure better employment, participate in civic life, and make informed decisions about health, family, and finance. When poor children are given the chance to learn in a supportive, well-equipped environment, it can change the trajectory of their entire family.

Government Interventions and the Road Ahead

India has introduced several schemes to tackle this issue, such as the **Mid-Day Meal Scheme**, **Right to Education Act**, **Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan**, and **Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya** for girls. These initiatives aim to improve enrollment, retention, and nutrition among poor children. Yet, implementation challenges and corruption often dilute their impact.

What is needed is a holistic approach—improving school infrastructure, enhancing teacher training, providing financial assistance for poor students, and addressing social norms that hinder education, especially for girls.

Conclusion

In the Indian context, poverty and education are tightly woven together in a cycle that requires sustained effort and political will to break. Bridging the educational gap for the poor is not only a matter of social justice but also essential for the nation's economic progress. Education must be seen not just as a right, but as a tool to eradicate poverty and build a more equitable society.

### **Blog 9: How to motivate children and the youth to study?**

_Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.” – Nelson Mandela_

We live in a time where distractions are everywhere — from mobile phones to social media, from games to endless entertainment. In such a world, motivating children and young people to study is becoming harder. But studying is not just about passing exams. It is about preparing for life, building skills, and shaping a better future.

In this blog, we will talk about why studying is important, who we mean when we say “children” and “youth,” why they often dislike studying, and how we can inspire them to love learning.

---

1\. Why Studying Is Important for Life, Not Just for Exams

Studying is not just a duty given by parents or teachers — it is a tool to understand the world better. Education gives us knowledge, but more than that, it gives us the power to think, solve problems, and make better decisions.

When we study:

- We open the door to more opportunities.

- We learn how to face life’s challenges.

- We grow in confidence and independence.

A student who studies well can choose the kind of life they want. Without education, choices become fewer. This is why studying is not only for marks or degrees — it is for building a strong foundation for the future.

In the long run, the habit of learning is more important than the information we memorize. Life keeps changing, and people who know how to learn can adapt to any new situation.

---

2\. Who We Mean by “Children” and “Youth”

When we say “children,” we usually mean those in school, from the early years until about age 12 or 13\. They are in their formative stage — curious, playful, and learning basic skills like reading, writing, and problem-solving.

“Youth” often refers to teenagers and young adults, roughly between ages 13 to 25\. This is the time when they face more choices and responsibilities. They start to think about their future careers, relationships, and independence.

Both groups are in important stages of life. Children are like seeds — they absorb what we give them. Youth are like growing plants — they need care, but they also start making their own choices. If we can motivate both to study with genuine interest, they can carry that habit into adulthood.

---

3\. Why Many Children and Young People Dislike Studying

It’s common to hear students say, “I hate studying.” The reasons are many, and understanding them is the first step to helping.

1. **Studying feels like a burden**  
   Many see studying as something forced on them by parents or teachers. When it feels like a duty, not a choice, they resist it.

2. **Lack of connection with real life**  
   Students often feel that what they are learning has no use in daily life. For example, solving algebra equations might seem pointless if no one explains how it can be applied.

3. **Pressure and fear of failure**  
   Marks, ranks, and competition create stress. Instead of enjoying learning, many only study to avoid punishment or embarrassment.

4. **Distractions**  
   TV, games, social media, and peer pressure often pull attention away from books.

5. **Lack of encouragement**  
   When effort is not noticed or appreciated, students may stop trying.

The truth is, no one hates learning itself. What they dislike is the way studying is presented to them. If we change the approach, the same students can become curious and motivated.

---

4\. Helping Them See the True Purpose of Studying

Motivation comes when children and youth understand _why_ they are doing something. Here are ways to help them see studying as meaningful:

a) Connect Studies to Their Dreams

If a child dreams of becoming a pilot, connect math to navigation, physics to flight, and geography to air routes. When they see the link between studies and their personal goals, they study with purpose.

b) Make Learning Fun

Games, stories, experiments, and real-life projects make studying exciting. For younger children, activities like building models or drawing charts can make concepts stick better.

c) Encourage Curiosity Over Perfection

Instead of only praising high marks, praise good questions and effort. Curiosity leads to deeper learning, while the fear of making mistakes kills creativity.

d) Show Real-Life Applications

When teaching history, talk about how past events shape our present. When teaching science, show how it explains everyday things — from cooking to using a phone.

e) Set Small, Achievable Goals

Breaking big tasks into smaller ones helps students feel progress. For example, instead of “finish the whole chapter,” set a goal to “understand one concept well today.”

f) Share Inspiring Stories

Tell them about people who started with very little but achieved great things through education — like A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, Malala Yousafzai, or even their own relatives.

g) Be a Role Model

Children and youth often imitate what they see. If parents and mentors read, learn, and speak positively about education, students are more likely to follow.

---

Conclusion: Learning Is a Lifelong Companion

Motivating children and young people to study is not about forcing them to memorize books. It is about helping them see the bigger picture — that learning shapes who they are, builds their future, and gives them the tools to change the world.

When children understand that studying is for _them_ — not just for teachers, parents, or exams — their attitude changes. They start to own their learning journey.

Education is a gift that stays for life. If we can make children and youth fall in love with learning, we are not just preparing them for exams — we are preparing them for a lifetime of success, confidence, and contribution to society.

### **Blog 10: Invisible Hands, Strong Economy: Valuing Women’s Silent Contribution**

_“What’s often ignored in our national accounts is the invisible backbone of the economy—the care work done mostly by women.”_ – Margaret G. Reid

When we think of “the economy,” we imagine banks, factories, markets, or stock charts. We think about people earning salaries, building businesses, or paying taxes. But beneath this visible world lies another economy — one that doesn’t appear in GDP numbers or tax returns. It’s powered by the silent, unpaid labor of millions of women who cook meals, raise children, care for the elderly, and keep households running.

This is work that doesn’t come with payslips, yet without it, paid work would collapse. In 2024, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that **708 million women** worldwide are excluded from the workforce because of unpaid care duties. In Asia and the Pacific, women spend **four times more hours than men** on unpaid work, and globally, they carry out about **76% of all unpaid care work**. If we valued this work at even the minimum wage, it would be worth around **USD 11 trillion** — nearly **9% of the world’s GDP**.

---

Why Valuing This Work Matters

For decades, economist Margaret G. Reid argued that ignoring household production in national accounts distorts our understanding of the economy. And she was right. When women’s contributions are invisible, so is their economic power.

Recognizing unpaid care work is not about charity — it’s about fairness and smart economics. When we put a value on care work, it forces policymakers to think differently. Suddenly, childcare centers, eldercare facilities, and caregiver allowances are not “luxuries” but essential investments.

The ILO’s 2024 _Resolution for Decent Work and the Care Economy_ pushes countries to create policies that ease the unpaid workload and help women join or remain in the workforce. Empowerment starts with recognition, and recognition starts with measurement. By counting women’s unpaid contributions, we give them leverage — in their homes, workplaces, and societies.

Real Stories Behind the Numbers

Statistics tell us the scale of the problem, but stories reveal its human side.

Take **Meena**, a 34-year-old from Bengaluru. She works as a customer support executive, logging in from home at 9 a.m. But before her shift even begins, she has already cooked breakfast, packed her children’s lunch, helped them get ready for school, and tended to her ageing mother-in-law. After work ends at 6 p.m., her “second shift” begins — cooking dinner, helping with homework, doing laundry. She earns a salary, but the majority of her day is spent doing unpaid work that enables everyone else in her family to function.

Or **Rukmini**, a farmer in rural Andhra Pradesh. She spends hours each day sowing, weeding, and harvesting alongside her husband — yet her name isn’t on land records, and she doesn’t get paid for her labor. After farm work, she takes care of her children, collects water, and cooks meals. The local economy benefits from her efforts, but she doesn’t get recognized as a “worker” in any official data.

Then there’s **Anjali**, a software engineer in Pune, who almost quit her job after becoming a mother. The high cost of daycare and lack of flexible hours made it nearly impossible to manage both roles. Her turning point came when her company introduced a work-from-home policy and a crèche subsidy. Suddenly, she could continue her career without feeling like she was failing at home. She says, _“The support didn’t just save my job — it saved my confidence.”_

These women are just three faces among millions. Their experiences underline a simple truth: unpaid care work is the silent infrastructure of our economy. Without it, businesses would lose workers, communities would lose stability, and society itself would struggle to function.

China vs. India: A Tale of Two Realities

China offers a striking example of what happens when women are part of the economic engine. Since the mid-20th century, Chinese women have been encouraged to work in farms, factories, schools, and offices. Today, women make up one of the most gender-balanced technical workforces in the world. Digital finance has also boosted women’s entrepreneurship, giving them more financial independence and bargaining power.

In contrast, India’s female labor force participation rate remains around **38%**, far behind China’s **60%** and Vietnam’s **70%**. The unpaid burden is enormous: Indian women perform **9.8 times more unpaid care work than men**. Even those in paid jobs spend **5.8 hours per day** on unpaid household tasks, on top of their working hours. That leaves little time for rest, skill-building, or professional growth.

The gap is not just about jobs — it’s about systems. China’s relatively stronger childcare infrastructure, workplace policies, and financial tools make it easier for women to work. In India, safety concerns, lack of flexible work, and rigid gender norms keep women at home, their contributions hidden from economic ledgers.

---

Making the Invisible Visible

If we want a stronger economy, we must start counting what counts. That means officially measuring unpaid care work and integrating it into national statistics. It means investing in childcare, eldercare, and flexible work options. It means encouraging men to share domestic duties so women have more time for education, paid work, or entrepreneurship.

China shows us that when women work, economies thrive. For India, recognizing and reducing the unpaid burden is key to unlocking an estimated **USD 0.3 trillion** in additional economic output. More importantly, it’s about dignity. Women are not “helping out” the economy from the sidelines — they are holding it up, day after day.

As the ILO’s 2024 resolution reminds us, a strong care economy creates jobs, supports families, and fuels growth. But we can’t build that future until we acknowledge the invisible hands that make the visible economy possible.

**Because an economy that ignores half of its workforce is only running at half its potential.**
